# Etch-a-Sketch
TOP Project 
This is a project a project to practice the DOM manipulation and JavaScript skills learned previously. 
It is described as not easy. I think that is a good thing to practice self-learning and breaking down problems
into sub-problems. I will reflect on this after I finished the project.
